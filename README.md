## Flexbox Website Layout

Flexbox is a relatively new front-end feature that makes building a website layout (and making it responsive!) much, much easier than it used to be.

In days past, to build a website, you would have to use float grids or even tables to make your layout look like it should. And those methods aren’t the best for responsive design– making sure the website looks good across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

If you want to stay current with web development trends, you definitely want to know how to use flexbox.

Because float grids are quickly becoming a thing of the past.
